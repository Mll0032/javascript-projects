// Experiment with this loop by modifying each of the following: the variable initialization, the boolean condition, and the update expression.

//for (let i = 0; i < 51; i++) {
  // console.log(i);
 //}


 //Chaning the number where I is initialized just changes the start position of the countup
 //for (let i = 2; i < 51; i++) {
 // console.log(i);
//}

//this created a forever loop since 0 is always going to be less that 51 the conditions will bever be false so it will contniue until there is no memory left in the computer 
for (let i = 0; i < 51; i--) {
  console.log(i);
  }
