    <p>I want to make a website that will allow a employees of a company to accuratly schedule themselves within certain perameters. Like they can arrive at work anywhere between between 6:30 am and 9:00 am and work until anywhere from 2:30 pm and 5:00 pm. That way the managers know when an employee is suppose to be at work and when they are off work. This type of scheduling allows associates to put in extra hours in and take hours off other times during the week for example employee A works 10 hours on Monday and on Tuesday which is 20 hours then they work 8 hours Wednesday - Thursday. that leaves them with only needing to work only 4 hours on Friday. This is fine when that is only 1 person. When you have a workforce of up to 250 people though this becomes exceedingly difficult to keep track of. </p>
